## [Live Version](https://lewisgormanneale.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

##Description 

This is an Etch A Sketch game created for the Odin Project's foundation Course. Lesson and project outlines can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch.

Currently only built to project specifications, but would like to add: 
- visual indicator of slider value (grid size)
- support for mobile devices
- draw by clicking and dragging, instead of hovering
